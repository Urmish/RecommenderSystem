Response to comments on question 5:
Yes, we do not want to pick users with PC similarity of negative sign.
Good observation. In this example, we knew that the similar users used for generating predictions
have rated all the movies that were unrated by Kim. So we did not worr about that.
In the next exercise, the MATLAB code does (must) take this into account.

Response to comments on question 1:
The mean is indeed removed before calculating similarity, and thus before finding similar users.

Response to comment on question 4:
You are correct. It would be intersting to see what is the impact of that.

Response to comment on question 5:
There are no direct issues as you think. The similarity weights are calculated based on mean centered ratings.
These similarity weights are subsequently used to find similar neighbors.
So we are in fact finding neighbors after removing the effect of mean.
